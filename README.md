# README
Most of my work on github is in a private repository either because it was for a company or because it was a class assignment (it is against Cornell Code of Academic Integrity to post solutions to assignments online). So if you'd like to see more of my work, let me know! Send me an email and I'll be glad to show you more of my code!
